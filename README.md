# Numerical analysis of RC circuit response
Use Python to do numerical analysis of a simple RC circuit. We will assume a capacitor is charged, and then at t=0 the change is removed and the capacitor discharges through a resistor. Print (or graph) the values of voltage and current at each time step.
